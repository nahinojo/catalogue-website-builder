        "The heated wire mesh inside the tube creates a turbulent flow of hot air that is convected upward and generates a white noise acoustic spectrum. The doubly open-ended tube behaves like an organ pipe and standing waves with antinodes at each end are filtered out of the white noise spectrum. The dominant frequency is thus given by:","$$f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L} $$","where $v =$ speed of sound in air = 343 m/s and $L =$ length = 0.97 m. These values give a frequency of 177 Hz and the associated loud booming will delight your students. Note that orienting the tube horizontally “turns the sound off” because hot air is no longer convected through the tube since there is no weight density gradient in the horizontal direction."
