        "This demonstration reveals the normally dispersive property of a glass prism. Dispersion is the property of a medium in which the incident electromagnetic wave (light) has a wavelength dependent phase velocity. This implies a wavelength dependent index of refraction, and in turn Snell’s Law predicts that different colors of visible light will be refracted at different angles as they emerge from the medium.In normal dispersion, such as a glass prism with visible light, this phenomenon is manifested by the shorter wavelength blue light being refracted (bent) at a greater angle than the higher wavelength red light."
