        "where $m_w =$ mass of weight, $m_b =$ mass of ball, $R =$ radius, and $T =$ period. Note that the weight of the mass, $m_w g$, provides the tension in the string, and it is actually this tension that exerts the centripetal force on the ball. Here, we also assume the contribution to the tension arising from friction between the string and support tube is negligible."
