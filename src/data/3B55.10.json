        "Very slowly rotate the speaker bar and notice the change in the amplitude of the sound.",
        "Keeping the bar still, ask the audience to slowly move their heads from side to side, noting the approximate distance their head must move to go from high amplitude to low amplitude.",
        "Notice that in large rooms, the distance required increases with the distance from the speaker bar.",
        "Disconnect one speaker and notice that the interference pattern disappears."
