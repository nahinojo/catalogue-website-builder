        "The angular acceleration of this gravity driven rotator can be adjusted by varying the moment of inertia of the rotator. This is accomplished by adjusting the location of the two sliding masses of the rotating assembly. The external torque is provided by a falling weight connected by string to a pulley mounted to the rotator.",
