        "Liquid nitrogen at 77Â° K cools the wafer composed of bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) until it becomes superconducting. In this state, the wafer will expel from its interior, the magnetic flux from the array of permanent magnets located beneath the wafer. This is the Meissner effect. In order to cancel the magnetic field within its interior, the superconductor must generate electric currents at its surface. These surface currents in fact create a mirror image of the permanent magnet and thus exert a repulsive force on the wafer, causing it to levitate."
