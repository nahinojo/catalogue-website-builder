        "Astrophysicists study the acoustic (sound) waves of stars as a means of determining that star’s internal composition (density) and structure. The field of helioseismology, which studies the propagation of pressure waves near the surface of our sun, is focused on the characteristic sound waves in this convection zone. The demonstration shows the analogous behavior of bowls with comparable size but different composition; each bowl rings out at a distinct frequency when set into oscillation."
