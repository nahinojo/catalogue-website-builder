        "Adjust the tank light arm and slit cover so beam lines up with 0-degree vertical line.",
        "Swing tank light arm through various angles noticing verification of both the law of reflection and the law of refraction. Note that total internal reflection occurs at about 49 deg (see Notes and Extras)."

        "The law of reflection states that the angles of incident and reflected rays are equal. The law of refraction states that the ratio of the angle of incidence to the angle of refraction is related to the ratio of indexes of refraction of the media containing the incident and refracted rays. In general, as a light ray travels from rarer to denser media, it is bent towards the normal to the interface between the two media."
