        "The reflection at a fixed end is inverted because the incoming pulse exerts a force on the rigid boundary that is opposite in direction to the reaction force the boundary exerts on the spring. The reflection at a free end is not inverted. If the mass density of the spring is $\\mu_1$ and that of the boundary is $\\mu_2$, then a fixed end reflection is modeled by $\\mu_2>>\\mu_1$ and vice-versa for a free end reflection. In the demonstration, a fixed end is accomplished by attaching the spring to the rod clamp while a free end is approximated by attaching the spring to a light string."
