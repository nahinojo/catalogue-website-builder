        "The thermal energy, $Q$, transferred from one sample to another is given by $Q = mc \\Delta T$ where $m$ is the mass, $c$ the specific heat, and $\\Delta T$ the temperature change. At 15°C, the specific heat of water (4186 J/ kg ⋅ °C) is almost five times the specific heat of aluminum (900 J/ kg ⋅ °C). Thus, for equal masses of water and aluminum, and the same amount of heat energy transferred to each sample, the sample of aluminum will experience the greater temperature change."
