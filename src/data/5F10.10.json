        "This demonstration verifies the relation $V = IR$, where $V$ is potential difference, $I$ is current, and $R$ the resistance. Some texts quibble with this as simply a definition of resistance, and claim that the correct statement of Ohm’s Law is $J = \\sigma E$, where $J$ is the current density, $\\sigma$ is conductivity, and E the electric field. Perhaps more importantly, only certain materials, called ohmic, obey these relations. Examples of nonohmic materials abound in modern microelectronics; many of the semiconductor components of a computer are prime examples."
