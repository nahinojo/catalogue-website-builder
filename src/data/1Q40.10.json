        "Since there is no external torque exerted on the system consisting of the person, stool, and weights, the angular momentum is constant as the weights are pulled inward. Since there is no change in the direction of angular momentum, the magnitude of angular momentum, $I \\omega$, is conserved. Assigning the subscripts i (initial) and f (final), we have:","$$ I_i \\omega_i = I_f \\omega_f $$","As the weights are brought in, $I_f < I_i$, since the rotation axis becomes smaller. In order to compensate, $\\omega_f > \\omega_i$ and the angular speed $\\omega$ increases."
