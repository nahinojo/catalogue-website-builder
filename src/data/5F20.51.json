        "After the basic series and parallel circuits have been presented in 5F20.50, further exploration can be made using the above hybrid circuits. For example, Board #2, configures two series circuits in parallel with one another with an equivalent resistance of $R_{\\text{eq}} = ( \\frac{1}{2R} + \\frac{1}{2R})^{-1} = R$. Recall that for the pure series and parallel circuits of four similar bulbs, that  equivalent resistances were $R/4$ and $4R$, respectively. So, the hybrid Board #2 shown above has an intermediate brightness. Once Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws of charge and energy conservation have been presented, Boards #1 and #3 can be analyzed and students can be questioned about the relative bulb brightness within each of these circuits. They can also be queried about the results of removing various individual bulbs."
