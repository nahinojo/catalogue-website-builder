        "The more massive balls are seen to move more slowly as expected. Also as the rotational speed of agitator bars is increased, simulating an increase of the temperature of a gas, the mean velocity of all the balls increases. The demonstration can also be used to illustrate that, for equal numbers of balls per unit volume, the larger balls have a smaller mean free path than the smaller balls."
