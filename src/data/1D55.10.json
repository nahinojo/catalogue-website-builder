        "Here we see that a body must have an external and centripetally directed force in order to move circularly. While in contact with the ring, the ball experiences a centripetal force provided by the normal force of the ring, and thus moves along a circular path. Once the ball exits the ring, there is no longer any force exerted by the ring, and so the ball must move along a straight-line path that is tangent to the ring at the exit point."
