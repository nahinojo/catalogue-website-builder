        "This apparatus allows for a comparison between the velocity of the center of mass, $v_{cm}$, and the velocity of a point on the rim, $v$, of a wheel that rolls without slipping. Because the velocity of a point on the rim is the sum of its translational and rotational components (where the rotational component is measured relative to the center of mass), it varies from zero at the bottom of the wheel to $2v_{cm}$ at the top of the wheel. Thus, $0 ≤ v ≤ 2v_{cm}$."
