        "The transformer converts line voltage, 120 VAC, to 15,000 VDC. This is sufficient to exceed the dielectric strength, also known as the breakdown voltage, of the air between the two conducting wires. Once this breakdown voltage (~30,000 V/cm) is exceeded, a conducting path between the wires is established and the air in between is ionized. As the energized electrons recombine with the positive ions, they emit the characteristic blue light observed. This is very similar to the plasma process observed for lightening."
