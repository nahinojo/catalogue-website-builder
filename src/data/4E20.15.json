        "Here is a straightforward demonstration of the inverse relationship between pressure $P$ and volume $V$ as dictated by the ideal gas law with temperature held constant in a closed system. As the volume of a syringe is increased, the audience can clearly see the pressure gauge values decrease. These values are recorded and a quick plot of $P$ versus $\\frac{1}{V}$ will reveal the predicted relation."
