        "Boiling occurs at the temperature at which the liquid’s vapor pressure equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Under standard conditions of pressure (one atmosphere) and elevation (sea level), water boils at 100 °C.","Since the boiling point decreases with decreasing vapor pressure, the pressure inside of the flask and surrounding the water can be lowered with a vacuum pump until the water vigorously boils at room temperature, ~ 22 °C. These concepts explain why cooking at higher elevation, where the atmospheric pressure is reduced, requires greater cooking times."
