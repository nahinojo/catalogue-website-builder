        "Repeat steps 1-3 while pinching the rod at the $L/4$ and then $L/6$ marks to excited other resonant frequencies.",
        "Pinch the rod with both hands at the marks between $L/4$ and $L/6$ and hit it against your knee to excite the transverse, non-sinusoidal standing waves."

        " If the rod is firmly held and stroked at $L/2$, $L/4$, and $L/6$, the corresponding audible frequencies are 1.4, 2.8, and 4.2 kHz. Additionally, when the rod is supported at the two locations between $L/4$ and $L/6$, and then excited, transverse, non-sinusoidal standing waves can be clearly observed"
