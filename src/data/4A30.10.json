        "Thermal expansion results from a change in the average separation distance between atoms as a material changes temperature. As the temperature of a material is increased, so does the amplitude of its atomic oscillations and average inter-atomic distances. Brass has a thermal expansion coefficient approximately twice as great as steel. Thus, brass will experience a greater expansion in its length than steel will for equal temperature changes. A bimetallic strip of steel and brass will thus bend toward the steel upon heating and toward the brass upon cooling."
