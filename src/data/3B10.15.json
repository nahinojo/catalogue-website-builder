        "Give the spring one up-down jerk to create a transverse pulse while starting the timer.",
        "Hold the spring steady and stop the timer when the pulse has covered the distance measured ten times.",
        "Calculate the average pulse speed using the measured time and distance.",
        "Pull up slack in the spring (to create more tension) while keeping the distance constant and repeat steps 1-5."
