        "High voltage applied to one end of the tube produces a horizontal electron beam. A bar magnet with its long axis oriented perpendicular to the plane of the above picture produces a vertical deflection of the beam. The direction of the force causing this deflection is given by:$$\\textbf{F}=q\\textbf{v}\\times\\textbf{B}$$where $\\textbf{v}$ is the electronâ€™s velocity and $\\textbf{B}$ is the magnetic field."
