        "Two balls are released simultaneously from the same height with zero vertical velocity. One ball has zero horizontal velocity, while the other has non-zero horizontal velocity. At any instant, the two balls have equal vertical position as shown above. So, both balls land simultaneously because their time of flight depends only on their initial height and vertical velocity. Thus, the horizontal and vertical motions, for projectiles experiencing only a vertical force due to gravity, are independent."
