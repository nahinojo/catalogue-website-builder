        "This apparatus demonstrates total internal reflection of a laser beam within various acrylic rods and a long fiber optic cable. For acrylic, which has about the same index of refraction as water ($n=1.33$), the critical angle is ~ 49°. For the fiber optic cable, which has an internal core ($n=1.5$) and cladding ($n=1.4$), the critical angle is ~42°."
