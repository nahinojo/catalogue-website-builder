        "In this demonstration, the interference pattern contains concentric circles about a central bright spot known as Airy’s disk. As for single and double slit diffraction, the wavelength of the laser light ($\\lambda$) can be determined from:$$\\lambda=\\frac{dx}{L},$$where $d$ is the pinhole diameter, $x$ the distance between the centers of the central bright spot and of the first dark circle, and $L$ the distance between the pinhole and observation screen."

        "Turn out the classroom lights to more easily see the diffraction pattern. Use the flashlight to help demonstrate in the darkness.",
        "For a more quantitative demonstration, measure the values of x, L and d in order to determine λ and compare it to its known value of 532 nm using the equation in the concept section."
