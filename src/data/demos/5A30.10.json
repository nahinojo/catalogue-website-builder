        "The metal wire is a good conductor because its atoms contain outer electrons that are only weakly bound to the nuclei. The large number of these free electrons explains the good conductivity of the copper wire. In contrast, the string contains electrons that are strongly bound to their nuclei and as such are classified as insulators."
