The magnetic field $\\textbf{B}$ points perpendicular to $\\textbf{L}$ and into the page as shown. The upward force on the conducting strip is then given by the right–hand rule. Reversing the magnet so that its field points out of the paper will of course produce a downward deflection of the current-carrying strip."
