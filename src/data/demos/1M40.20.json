        "Assuming the ball is released from rest, what should its minimum initial height be in order to completely orbit the circular loop of radius $R$? This is a classic textbook problem requiring both energy conservation and the analysis of forces at the top of the loop. Neglecting the radius of the ball, $r$, compared to the loop’s radius, $R$, energy conservation from the initial position, $h$, to the loop’s top at $2R$ gives",
