        "The natural convection of fluid shown here results from the effect of buoyancy. At the burner’s flame, the water is heated and therefore becomes less dense. Consequently, the warmed water rises and cooler water circulates behind it towards the flame. Both liquids and gasses transmit heat mainly by convection. Another vivid example of convection shows that you can hold your fingers beside a candle’s flame without harm, but not above the flame. Be careful should you try to verify this at home."
