        "This apparatus allows the spring constant, $k$, of a spring to be determined using Hooke’s Law, $F = −kx$ , where $F$ is the force on the spring and $x$ is its displacement from equilibrium. Once the spring constant has been determined, it can be used to predict the period of oscillation, $T$, of a given mass $m$ via:$$T = 2 \\pi \\frac{m}{k}$$",
