        "The locations of the intensity maxima for a multiple slit aperture (where the number of slits is three or more) are the same as the locations given for the double slit. However, as the number of slits increases, the shape of each intensity peak becomes narrower and sharper, and the peak intensities increase as well. In the limit of a very large number of slits, the arrangement is called a grating. Since the resolution of gratings is especially high, they are an ideal tool for atomic spectroscopic analysis."

        "Move the lab jack in line with the laser and use the knobs to adjust the height and position of the slide so the laser is going through the desired slits while the reflected beam is hitting the small white screen on the support stand. Be careful not to reflect laser light into someoneâ€™s eyes!",
