        "The period of small oscillations of a simple pendulum is given by $Τ = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}$ where $L$ is the pendulum length and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. In the demonstration, the period for various lengths can be predicted using the above formula and then compared to the observed values.",
        "The increased period of larger amplitude oscillations can also be observed by initially displacing the ball ~60° from the vertical."
