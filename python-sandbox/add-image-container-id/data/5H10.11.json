        "This demonstration reveals the key characteristics of the field lines of a permanent magnet:<ul><li>There are (to date) no magnetic monopoles, only dipoles and combinations of dipoles. Hence, the field lines must begin and end at opposite poles. The B-field vectors are tangent to the lines at all points.</li><li>The density of field lines is proportional to the magnetic field strength in that region.</li><li>Field lines never cross themselves (otherwise the field would have an ambiguous direction at the crossings).</li></ul>"
