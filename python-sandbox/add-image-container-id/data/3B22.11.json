        "Verify that the trigger on the jigsaw is compressed and locked in the on position using the “lock” button on the handle.",
        "Turn knob on the variac down to 0 volts and toggle the “on” switch to the 120 volt setting.",
        "Slowly increase the voltage supplied to the jigsaw by turning the dial on the variac. An increase in voltage corresponds to an increase the frequency of oscillation of the rope end.",
        "Dial through various normal modes of vibration for the rope (fundamental, 2nd, 3th harmonics)."
