        "If the monkey drops from rest at the same instant the ball leaves the launcher, and the only force on the two objects is assumed to be gravity, where should the launcher be aimed if the monkey and ball collide? This is the classic Monkey & Hunter question. Because each object experiences the same acceleration downward due to gravity, and the solution does not depend on the size of this acceleration, the solution must be valid for the case when there is zero gravity. Clearly, the ball must, for this case and those with non-zero gravity, be aimed directly at the monkey. In the case of non-zero gravity, both monkey and ball fall the same distance, $\\frac{1}{2}g t^2$. Note: we must assume there is sufficient muzzle velocity of the ball so that collision occurs before the monkey hits the ground."
