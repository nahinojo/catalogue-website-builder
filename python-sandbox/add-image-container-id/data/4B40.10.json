        "This is a vivid demonstration of the transmission and focusing of electromagnetic radiation. A heated wire located at the focus of one parabolic reflector emits radiation that is collected on a match head located at the focus of a second parabolic reflector. The infrared radiation (heat) absorbed by the match is eventually sufficient to ignite the match."
