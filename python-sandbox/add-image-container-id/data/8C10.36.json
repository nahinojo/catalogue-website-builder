        "This sphere-like polyhedron can be used to model the expansion of the universe, where the glow-in-the-dark connectors represent galaxies and the purple structures the fabric of spacetime. As the model expands, the connectors all move further away from one another. So the distance between any two connectors will increase. The model is not intended to suggest that space is expanding into anything outside of itself, but rather that it is an intrinsic expansion defined by a relative separation of parts."
