        "The discharge of the tungsten filament of an <span class=\"italic\">incandescent</span> bulb forms a continuum of color because of the relatively large number of transition energies available to the atoms in its solid lattice. The relatively large number of transitions is due to the relatively large number of translational, rotational, and vibrational degrees of freedom of the lattice atoms. In contrast, the line sources (hydrogen, helium, and neon) contain gas at low pressure. When excited, these gasses have relatively few transitions available in the visible spectrum, thus forming the characteristic narrow bands or spectral lines."
